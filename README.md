## Introduction and Motivation

The life of a modern-day human being is hard to imagine without the Internet. Our lives are increasingly automated and digital, making them complex. This makes many people vulnerable to cybercrimes, such as phishing.  

According to [phishing.org](https://www.phishing.org/), phishing is a cybercrime in which a target or targets are contacted by email, telephone, or text message by someone posing as a legitimate institution to lure individuals into providing sensitive data such as personally identifiable information, banking and credit card details, and passwords.

There are ways to detect phishing attacks, but attackers evolve over time. One robust approach is using **Machine Learning** to detect phishing websites.  

As an aspiring tech and cybersecurity enthusiast, I developed a project called **"PhishCap"** to detect whether a website is legitimate using Machine Learning.
